# Jira Software Docker Images

Atlassian Jira Software container for Server and Data Center deployments. These images are based on the official images at [atlassian/jira-software](https://hub.docker.com/r/atlassian/jira-software). Currently the only addition is the available `-mysql` suffix which includes the mysql connector neccessary for running Jira Software on MySQL 5.6 or 5.7.
